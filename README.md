This repository provides the source code for the **Improved Educational Competition Optimizer (IECO)**, a novel optimization algorithm designed for advanced engineering optimization tasks.

## Overview

The IECO source code includes two distinct sets of benchmark test functions:
- **Standard Benchmark Functions**: Classical test functions commonly used for evaluating optimization algorithms.
- **Shifted Benchmark Functions**: Classical functions that have been shifted to avoid the bias towards the origin, aiding in better generalization and preventing overfitting.

The repository is structured into folders that can be executed directly using the provided `main` files for easy experimentation and testing.

## Features

- **Early Stopping Mechanism**: The improved version of IECO incorporates an early stopping feature implemented through two `m` files, enhancing the algorithm's efficiency and robustness.
- **User-Friendly Implementation**: The code is designed for easy integration and use in your own optimization experiments.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the desired test function set.
3. Run the `main` file to start the optimization process.

Detailed documentation for running and modifying the code is provided within the comments of each file. For an in-depth explanation of the algorithm and its implementation, please refer to the upcoming publication.
